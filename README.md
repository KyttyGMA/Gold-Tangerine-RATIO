***DESCRIPTION:*** The page fetches the API endpoint at the ***nodeless-api*** deployed project and displays the response in a paragraph element. The response is expected to be a string representing the number of tangerines that can be bought with one unit of gold


***NOTES*** This code assumes that the API endpoint returns a string representing the number of tangerines that can be bought with one unit of gold. If the API returns an error or an invalid response, the page will display an error message accordingly
